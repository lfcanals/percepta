# In a sentence
Create an opensource ADAS

# Main goals

1. Lane detection : software solution
2. Install in the car : hardware solution
3. Transfer to mini-PC into the car
4. Extend to animal, cars, humans detection
5. Deploy into the car


# Packages

    * calibration: objects useful for eye fish calibration
    * camera: object representaion of simplest camera capture
    * lanedetection: objects useful for lane detection
    * recording: objects useful for recording
    * realtime: realtime objects with the developed fetures (detection, calibration, recording...)
